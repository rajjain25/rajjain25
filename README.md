- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @rajjain25
- I am working as Wordpress Developer at The Social Box with 20-month experience in digital marketing agency.
  
-I did my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Pandit Deendayal Energy University. As an electrical engineer with a zeal towards learning new technologies. I strive to find the fusion between both the fields.

-I want to secure a position in a company that challenges my skills, updates my current knowledge, and sharpens my training to forge a successful path for both the company and my future. I am open to all sorts of opportunities that may come my way to mould and polish myself for growth and development. I am an enthusiast to work individually as well as in teams. Diligent, Self-determined and Detail-oriented Professional.

-My hobbies are listening to music, playing and watching cricket, travelling new places. I am a highly motivated individual who believes in continuous learning and is up for challenging opportunities. Humility and hard work are the traits I resonate most with.

Looking for great job opportunities:
